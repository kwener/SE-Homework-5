-In this project, I am not using any build tools (like maven or gradle), and i am working in VSCode
    -In vscode, the Test Runner extension for java must be downloaded

    -junit.jar and hamcrest-core.jar must be downloaded. I did so through the "Testing" icon on the left bar in VSCode
        -The is an option to "Enable java testing", when i then selected the option to use junit and the lib folder/dependencies were installed automatically
        -I then updated my dependencies in the settings.json file with the line   
          "java.project.referencedLibraries":[
        "lib/**/*.jar"
        ]

-If you are running this code with Maven or Gradle, please ensure that you add junit to your dependencies
    -in pom.xml for maven and build.gradle for gradle

-To actually run the test, i went to the Test runner java extension (the little beaker), and pressed the arrow icon next to the question2 folder
